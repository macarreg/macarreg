### 💡 Projects

#### 🧩 [Knowledge-Based SOMA Solver](https://github.com/macarreg/soma-solver)
Interactive 3D SOMA Cube built with **JavaScript** and **Python backend**.  
Implements symmetry-pruned validity checking for efficient puzzle solving.
Created an inference engine and knowledge rules to tackle large number of possible orientations.

#### 🏠 [Cal Poly Prop Hunt](https://kind-mushroom-09c109a1e.6.azurestaticapps.net/)
Worked with a team to deploy a full-stack property listing app using **React**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**, deployed via **Azure**.
I led the form logic and deployment process while assisting with some navigation and search features.

#### 🏆 [3-Player Prisoner's Dilemma](https://github.com/macarreg/PrisonersDilemma)
Recreated Robert Axelrod's famous tournament of strategies with 3 (and more) players to see if a new strategy would arise.
Used an unsupervised learning agent to attempt to find a pattern / vulnerability in the scores to create a new strategy. 
Discovered that "nasty" strategies always prevail on average. The more players, the better a nasty strategy will perform.

#### 🧱 [UML Drawing Application](https://github.com/macarreg/uml-drawer)
Collaborative **Java** UML editor with GUI, cloud-logging, and **MVC** design.

### 🧠 TURF (Totally unnecessary random facts)
- I love youtube channels like Veritasium and Vsauce (where most of my ideas stem from).
- Wii games are my greatest vice. I am always looking for new ways to spice-up Mario Kart Wii with mods.
- I followed the classic baseball | golf pipeline (add me on 18-birdies lol)
